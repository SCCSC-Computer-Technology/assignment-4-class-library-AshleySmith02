The first thing I noticed is that she did not include properties/constructor. 
I would definitely suggest adding that for the properties of the states database. 
However, Ashley included a very good amount of comments that explain all of the code that she has. 
She also included her methods for updating the median and searching for states in the library. 
This is very good because it keeps her code organized while also including these queries in a library that can be reused in another program.
Overall, this is a good library!
